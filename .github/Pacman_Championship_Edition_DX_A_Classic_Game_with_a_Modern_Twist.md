Pacman Championship Edition DX+ is a game that will challenge your skills and reflexes. You will have to navigate through the mazes, avoid the ghosts and eat as many dots and fruits as you can. The game has a dynamic difficulty system that adjusts to your performance. The more you play, the faster and smarter the ghosts become. You will also encounter sleeping ghosts that will wake up and chase you when you pass by them. To escape them, you can use the power pellets that turn the ghosts blue and make them edible. You can also use the bombs that blast away all the ghosts on the screen.
 
One of the most thrilling aspects of Pacman Championship Edition DX+ is the ghost combo system. When you eat a power pellet, you can eat multiple ghosts in a row to create a ghost combo. The more ghosts you eat, the higher your score and the longer your power pellet lasts. However, if you miss a ghost or run out of time, your combo will end and you will have to start over. The game also has a chain system that rewards you for eating dots and fruits in succession. The more you chain, the faster your Pacman moves and the more points you get.
 
Pacman Championship Edition DX+ is a game that will test your strategy and creativity. You can choose from different game modes that have different objectives and rules. For example, in Score Attack mode, you have to score as many points as possible in a fixed time limit. In Time Trial mode, you have to clear a certain number of mazes as fast as you can. In Ghost Combo mode, you have to create the longest ghost combo possible. In Darkness mode, you have to play in a dark maze with limited visibility. Each mode has different mazes and power-ups that require different approaches and tactics.
