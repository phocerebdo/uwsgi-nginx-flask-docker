## How to update the commentary file for FIFA 07
 
The commentary file for FIFA 07 is located in the data/audio folder of your game installation directory. The file name is comm.big and it contains all the audio files for the commentators. To update this file, you will need to download a patch that adds new callnames for players and teams that are not included in the original game. There are several patches available online, but one of the most popular ones is the one created by OldSchool\_7[^1^], who imported some callnames from FIFA 14 for players from Croatia and Italy. You can download this patch from here: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/33b1t9tfr2vpo53/commentary\_patch.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/33b1t9tfr2vpo53/commentary_patch.rar)
 
To install this patch, you will need to extract the rar file and copy the comm.big file to your data/audio folder, replacing the original one. Make sure you backup your original file before doing this, in case you want to revert back to it later. After copying the file, you can launch your game and enjoy the new commentary.
 
## How to change the commentary language for FIFA 07

To use this program, you will need to extract the zip file and run the setup.exe file. Then, you will need to select your game installation directory and choose the language you want to install. The program will automatically copy the necessary files to your game folder and create a shortcut on your desktop with the selected language.
